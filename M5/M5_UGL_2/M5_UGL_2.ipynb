    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Lab Overview  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will step into the role of a **technical AI lead at a fashion brand** preparing a summer sunglasses campaign. Your task is to design a **fully automated creative pipeline** that mirrors a real-world business scenario. Instead of handling each piece manually, you will guide a system that scans online sources for emerging fashion trends, matches those trends with sunglasses in the internal catalog, designs a campaign visual, generates a short marketing quote, and finally packages everything into an **executive-ready report**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to experience how multiple agents, tools, and models can be orchestrated into a single, coherent workflow. By the end of this lab, you will have built a pipeline that feels less like a script of isolated steps and more like a small team working together to solve a creative challenge.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. 🎯 Learning outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you will see how to move beyond single-turn interactions with a model and instead design **multi-agent pipelines** that coordinate planning, research, and creative generation. You will learn how to ground agent reasoning in external tools so that outputs are not just imaginative but also supported by real data. You will also experiment with reflection and packaging steps that enforce quality control and prepare results for an executive audience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, this lab is about learning how to combine the **imagination of large language models** with the **discipline of structured workflows**, giving you a practical pattern for building autonomous systems that are both creative and reliable.  "

       "\n",
       "1. Top Trends  \n",
       "   • Tinted-Lens Minimalism  \n",
       "     – Pastel and barely-there tinting (pale pinks, greens, lavenders) over classic shapes is everywhere. Think subtle color washes rather than dark, uniform lens.  \n",
       "   • ‘60s-Inspired Sculptural Frames (Cat-Eye Redux)  \n",
       "     – Exaggerated cat-eye silhouettes with upward-swept corners and slightly thicker temples—modern, feminine and statement-making.  \n",
       "   • Sporty/Wraparound and Shield Styles  \n",
       "     – Streamlined, single-lens or semi-shield designs borrowed from activewear—often with rubberized nose/grip details for comfort and a technical finish.  \n",
       "\n",
       "2. Catalog Matches  \n",
       "   • Mystique (SG003)  \n",
       "     – Classic 1950s cat-eye elevated with an elegant, upswept temple. Its sculptural lines are a perfect canvas for either a bold acetate color or a summer-ready translucent tint. Limited stock (3), so it’s a premium, exclusive offering.  \n",
       "   • Sport (SG004)  \n",
       "     – A true wraparound silhouette with a single curved lens and rubber grips. It ticks the “active-luxe” box and can be offered in bright summer palettes or mirrored finishes. Plenty in stock (11).  \n",
       "   • Aviator (SG001)  \n",
       "     – The archetypal pilot shape—large teardrop lenses and slender metal rims. While timeless, it adapts seamlessly to a tinted-lens treatment (e.g., gradient pastel or light mirrored). Stock of 23 ensures scale.  \n",
       "\n",
       "3. Why These Are a Good Fit  \n",
       "   – Mystique meets the surge in cat-eye frames with a polished, high-impact look that reads couture yet remains wearable.  \n",
       "   – Sport answers the demand for hybrid athleisure eyewear, giving both performance cues and street-style cred.  \n",
       "   – Aviator ties into both the oversized‐metal and tinted‐lens currents, while leveraging a universally recognized silhouette that sells itself.  \n",
       "\n",
       "By featuring Mystique and Sport as hero pieces (with Aviator as a versatile staple), you’ll cover the major summer 2025 eyewear currents—pastel-tinted minimalism, sculptural vintage nods, and technical-chic wraparounds—in one cohesive campaign.</pre>\n",

    "\n",
    "By completing this lab, you have seen how to:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Use **multi-agent LLM pipelines** to automate a creative workflow end-to-end.  \n",
    "- Combine **reasoning, tool-calling, and external data** to ground your outputs in reality.  \n",
    "- Apply multimodal models (like `gpt-4o`) that process **both text and images** for tasks such as generating campaign quotes.  \n",
    "- Extend the model’s abilities with tools (`tavily_search_tool`, `product_catalog_tool`) so your outputs are not only imaginative but also practical.  \n",
    "- Keep execution **transparent and debuggable** with structured logging and HTML-styled blocks.  \n",
    "- Deliver a polished, **executive-ready report** in Markdown format that blends insights, visuals, and justifications into a single artifact.  \n",
