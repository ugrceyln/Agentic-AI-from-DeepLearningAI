    "\n",
    "Lastly, it's important to remember that LLMs can use multiple tools at and go through a sequence of tool calls to accomplish multiple things. Let's use your tools and examine the `response` to see what happens. You will use a complex prompt,\n",
    "\n",
    "> Can you help me create a qr code that goes to www.deeplearning.com from the image dl_logo.jpg? Also write me a txt note with the current weather please.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt requires a good amount of logic to understand what to call and when. For example, although you ask it to write a text note first and then describe the contents, the LLM will need that information first to pass it to the text note. If the LLM asked to use `write_txt_file` first, it would not have the information from `get_weather_from_ip`. This is a good example of the power of LLMs to parse natural language and use appropriate tools in the right order to accomplish a wide variety of tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can experiment with different OpenAI models when running these tool-calling workflows. Each model offers a different balance of capability, cost, and speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`openai:gpt-4o`** — optimized for reasoning and speed\n",
    "- **`openai:gpt-4.1`** — strong reasoning performance, good for complex tasks\n",
    "- **`openai:gpt-4.1-mini`** — lighter, faster, and cheaper than full GPT-4.1\n",
    "- **`openai:gpt-3.5-turbo`** — efficient for simpler tasks and quick iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a model depends on your goals:\n",
    "- Use smaller models for fast, low-cost prototyping\n",
    "- Switch to stronger models when tasks require better reasoning or multi-step orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tool calling lets LLMs go beyond text generation—they can now use functions as part of their reasoning.\n",
    "- Clear, well-documented functions (with precise docstrings) help the model know when and how to use each tool.\n",
    "- AISuite handles the complexity of translating python functions into tool schemas and orchestrating multi-step workflows.\n",
    "- Choosing the right model matters: smaller models are faster and cheaper for simple tasks, while stronger models are better for reasoning-heavy workflows.\n",
    "- Watching the conversation flow (prompts, tool calls, results, final response) is essential for debugging and improving agentic behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these elements in place, you now have the foundation to design agents that combine LLM reasoning with external tools to complete more complex tasks.\n"
